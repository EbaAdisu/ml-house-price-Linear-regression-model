# Overview

This repository hosts a machine learning project aimed at predicting house prices using a linear regression model. The model takes into account key features such as square footage, the number of bedrooms, and the number of bathrooms to estimate property values.

## Features
Linear Regression Model: Utilizes a simple linear regression algorithm.
# Dataset: 
The model is trained and tested on a dataset containing information about house prices, square footage, bedrooms, and bathrooms.
# Jupyter Notebook: 
The main implementation is provided in the house_price_prediction.ipynb Jupyter Notebook.
Getting Started
# Dependencies: 
Install the required dependencies by running pip install -r requirements.txt.
# Run the Notebook: 
Execute the Jupyter Notebook house_price_prediction.ipynb to explore the code and results.
## Project Structure
